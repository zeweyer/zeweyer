## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **applied mathematics, scientific computing,
and interpretable machine learning**, with a particular focus on **symbolic regression**.

I am interested in discovering **compact, analytic, and physically meaningful mathematical
representations** of complex systems from data, and in developing modeling frameworks
that balance **predictive accuracy, interpretability, and physical consistency**.

Current application areas include:
- Energy systems and refrigeration performance modeling
- Coarse-grained interaction potentials in computational physics
- Data-driven scientific regression under structural and physical constraints
